The `MAX_PRODUCTS` variable in your code is used as an upper limit for the total number of products to scrape across all pages of a category. Here's how it works in your code:

### Role of `MAX_PRODUCTS`
1. **Limit Total Products Scraped per Category**:
   - In the `scrape_category` function, the loop continues to scrape pages of a category until the number of scraped products (`len(all_products)`) reaches `MAX_PRODUCTS`.

2. **Conditional Checks**:
   - Inside the loop:
     ```python
     if len(all_products) >= MAX_PRODUCTS:
         break
     ```
     This ensures that once the total products scraped across pages reach the limit defined by `MAX_PRODUCTS`, the scraping for the current category stops.

3. **Pagination Control**:
   - Even if there are more pages to scrape in a category, the script stops fetching new pages once the desired number of products (`MAX_PRODUCTS`) has been collected.

### Combined Use with `max_items`
- In `scrape_page`, the `max_items` parameter (default set to 10) controls how many products are scraped from a **single page**.
- These two variables together control:
  - **How many products to scrape per page** (`max_items`).
  - **How many products to scrape in total per category** (`MAX_PRODUCTS`).

### Example
If:
- `MAX_PRODUCTS = 10`
- `max_items = 5`

Then:
- The scraper will collect up to 10 products per category.
- On each page, it will scrape up to 5 products, meaning it will fetch products from 2 pages (if each page has enough items).

### Why `MAX_PRODUCTS` is Useful
- **Efficiency**: Prevents over-scraping a category, which could slow down the script or result in unnecessary data.
- **Scalability**: Helps you define a manageable dataset size for analysis or testing.
- **Resource Management**: Reduces the number of requests to Amazon, minimizing the chances of being flagged or encountering CAPTCHA.
